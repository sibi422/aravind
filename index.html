              <p>
                The settlements required a large number of laborers to sustain them, 
                and thus laborers were imported from Africa. African slaves began 
                arriving in Virginia in 1619. The term “plantation” arose as the 
                southern settlements, originally linked with colonial expansion, 
                came to revolve around the production of agriculture.

                Fertilizers may be distinct from liming materials or other non-nutrient soil amendments. 
                Many sources of fertilizer exist, both natural and industrially produced.

                Agriculture is the practice of cultivating plants and livestock.
                [1] Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary
                 human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species created 
                 food surpluses that enabled people to live in cities. The history 
                 of agriculture began thousands of years ago. After gathering wild 
                 grains beginning at least 105,000 years ago, nascent farmers began 
                 to plant them around 11,500 years ago. Pigs, sheep.

                <h3><b>5 steps to successful farm project planning</b></h3><br><br>
                1. The idea<br>
                Have a family discussion, collate all required
                 information and speak to people who have already
                  implemented a similar project. Get an idea of
                   costs and create a draft business plan.<br>
                2. Speak to the accountant<br>
                “You need to be proactive – it’s easier to deal with
                 things before they happen,” says Brian Harvey, partner
                  at accountant Francis Clark. “Look at the objective of
                   the proposal and the tax implications, including income
                    tax, capital gains tax (CGT) and inheritance tax (IHT).
                     If someone is considering retiring in a few years,
                      work succession into your plan. And consider structure 
                      and ownership of the business – it’s scary how often 
                      legal titles do not tally up with expectations.”<br>
                3. Speak to the lawyer<br>
                “You have to think about how the project will interact with
                 the existing business,” says Joel Woolf, head of agriculture
                  at solicitor Foot Anstey. “What if something goes wrong?
                   You may want to ring-fence the business so it doesn’t take 
                   the farm with it. And look at wills, power of attorney
                    and who else has a call on the farm.”<br>
                4. Hold a family/business meeting<br>
                “We need to understand the risks and benefits – at this stage
                 it’s all about understanding the project,” says Paul Johns, 
                 agriculture relationship director at Lloyds Bank. “We need
                  to know how the business is operating now and how it will
                   operate in the future; there are all sorts of practical 
                   questions that arise as a result of each change.”<br>
                5. Complete the project<br>
                “It’s easy to lose enthusiasm for a project when the build is finished,
                 but that’s the quickest way for things to get out of hand,” says Mr Woolf.
                  “Sit back down with the family and check where everyone is going from
                   here – and there’s no harm in having a wash-up with your professional
                    advisers to see how you would do things differently with future projects.”

               <h1>Farmer</h1><br>
                 <p>
                  A farmer[1] is a person engaged in agriculture, raising living organisms
                   for food or raw materials. The term usually applies to people who do some
                    combination of raising field crops, orchards, vineyards, poultry, or other
                     livestock. A farmer might own the farmed land or might work as a 
                     laborer on land owned by others, but in most developed economies,
                      a farmer is usually a farm owner, while employees of the farm are
                       known as farm workers, or farmhands. However, in other older definitions
                        a farmer was a person who promotes or improves the growth of plants,
                         land or crops or raises animals (as livestock or fish) by labor and attention</p><br>

        <h1>Harvesting</h1><br><br>
        <p>
          Harvesting is the process of gathering a ripe
          crop from the fields. Reaping is the cutting 
          of grain or pulse for harvest, typically using
          a scythe, sickle, or reaper.[1] On smaller
          farms with minimal mechanization, harvesting
          is the most labor-intensive activity of the
          growing season. On large mechanized farms,
          harvesting uses the most expensive and 
          sophisticated farm machinery, such as
          the combine harvester. Process automation 
          has increased the efficiency of both the
          seeding and harvesting processes. Specialized
          harvesting equipment utilizing conveyor belts
          to mimic gentle gripping and mass-transport
          replaces the manual task of removing 
          each seedling by hand.[2] The term "harvesting"
          in general usage may include immediate
          postharvest handling, including cleaning,
          sorting, packing, and cooling.
